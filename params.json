{"name":"Toolkit","body":"## Welcome to ToolKit\r\nToolKit is an iPhone app that aims to be easily configurable by a researcher interested in environmental participatory sensing.  ToolKit records environmental data using the phones sensors to be uploaded at the end of a session by a user.  Each view is completely self contained and independent of the others.\r\n\r\nIf you have git installed, you can clone this project\r\n\r\n`$ git clone git@github.com:eternalmatt/ToolKit.git`\r\n\r\nOr you can download a zip of the most recent version.\r\n\r\n### Sensors\r\nRecent smartphones contain numerous sensors such as accelerometers, gps, cameras, microphones, and more.  We aim to take advantage of these sensors in ToolKit in an elegant way such that a user can record data near them easily and upload to a researcher with minimal effort.\r\n\r\n### Self-Contained Views\r\nModularity is key.  ToolKit provides many views that are completely self-contained and are unaware that other views exist. With this structure, we can allow a researcher to build an entire interface in minutes because they remain abstracted away from the implementation details of the sensors.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n### About Me\r\nMy name is Matt Senn and I'm a computer science student at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.  I love programming, reading tech news, and a good Bahn Mi sandwich.\r\nEmail me if you'd like to know at [eternalmatt@gmail.com](eternalmatt@gmail.com)","tagline":"Environmental sensing senior project","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
